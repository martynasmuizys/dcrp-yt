A browser extension that displays YouTube's current playing playlist video.

Works only on Windows 10/11 (for now)

Extension requires host application to be installed, otherwise it won't work.

This is a fun little side project that I did to learn some stuff.

## Install
[Download the extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/4428655/c4e7220360094013b2a9-1.0.3.xpi)

[Download native app installer]()
