- Supported platforms: Windows 10/11 (for now);
- Supported browsers: Mozilla;

- Multiple playlist support.

## Note
üóø This is a fun little side project that I did to learn some stuff. Might improve might not. Using some JavaScript library (such as Discord Embedded SDK or discordjs/RPC) would have been better, but idc. Don't want to make this a major thingy. Might rewrite to use IPC instead that SHOULD allow more control. idk. need more research
